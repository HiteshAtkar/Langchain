Human evolution is the long process through which modern humans (Homo sapiens) developed from early ancestors over millions of years. It began with primate species in Africa, where traits such as bipedalism (walking on two legs) first appeared in hominins like Australopithecus. Over time, different species such as Homo habilis and Homo erectus showed increasing brain size, tool use, and social behaviors. Around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans emerged, marked by advanced cognitive abilities, language, and culture. Migration out of Africa allowed humans to adapt to diverse environments, leading to the spread of civilizations across the globe. This evolutionary journey highlights how biology, environment, and culture shaped humans into the species we are today.
